            <h3>Donors</h3>
            <p>
            Donors are given the tools to further their giving by being able to donate monetarily, volunteer, and request pickups for items they would like to donate. Furthermore, they’re able to view tax deductions throughout the year, stay up-to-date on world causes, join local nonprofit events, and communicate through our social media platform.

            <h3>Students</h3>
            <p>
              Our school volunteering partnership connects students with the communities and causes they care about. Students are able to give their time, build volunteer hours, and participate in the rewards program where they’re able to trade in volunteer hours for various prizes. Most importantly, students are able to build lasting relationships while being proactive in their communities.

            <h3>Business</h3>
            <p>
              Through our feature Connecting the Dots, businesses are able to post various items they have available to give to nonprofits (Panera: extra bread, Dell: old computers). Through this feature, One Benefactor’s goal is to help encourage businesses to give back to the communities while connecting with the causes they care about.

            <h3>Non Profit</h3>
            <p>
              Nonprofits are able to benefit from the many methods of giving available on the platform as well as communicate with their donors and communities to keep them updated and informed. We allow small to mid-sized nonprofits to customize their donor management system packages based off of their current needs without the massive expense for partially used and complex system tools. Our CRM system allows nonprofits to keep records, manage funds and employees, message, email, and set pickup and drop off sites.
